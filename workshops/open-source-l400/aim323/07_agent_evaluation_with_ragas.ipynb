    "# Agent Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore the evaluation of agentic systems. Agentic systems are complex constructs consisting of multiple sub-components. In Lab 3, we examined a simple singleton agent orchestrating between two tools. Lab 4 demonstrated a more sophisticated multi-layer agentic system with a top-level router agent coordinating multiple agentic sub-systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One direct implication of the interdependent and potentially nested nature of agentic systems is that evaluation can occur at both macro and micro levels. This means that either the entire system as a whole is being evaluated (macro view) or each individual sub-component is assessed (micro view). For nested systems, this applies to every level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, evaluation begins at the macro level. In many cases, positive evaluation results at the macro level indicate sufficient agent performance. If macro-level performance evaluation proves insufficient or yields poor results, micro-level evaluation can help decompose the performance metrics and attribute results to specific sub-components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will first explore macro-level agent performance evaluation. Then, we will evaluate tool usage as a lower-level task. To maintain focus on the evaluation process, we will keep the agentic system simple by utilizing the singleton agent composed in Lab 3."

    "As covered in the previous section, we will reuse the Agent we built in Lab 3. This agent has access to tools designed to help find vacation destinations.

    "## Agent Evaluation with RAGAS\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore sophisticated methods for evaluating agentic systems using the RAGAS framework. Building upon our previous work with the vacation destination agent from Lab 3, we'll implement both high-level (macro) and low-level (micro) evaluation approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAGAS provides specialized tools for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications, with particular emphasis on agentic systems. We'll focus on two key evaluation dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [High-Level Agent Accuracy](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/agents/#agent-goal-accuracy):\n",
    "   - Agent Goal Accuracy (with reference): Measures how well the agent achieves specified goals by comparing outcomes against annotated reference responses\n",
    "   - Agent Goal Accuracy (without reference): Evaluates goal achievement by inferring desired outcomes from user interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Low-Level Tool Usage](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/agents/#tool-call-accuracy):\n",
    "   - Tool Call Accuracy: Assesses the agent's ability to identify and utilize appropriate tools by comparing actual tool calls against reference tool calls\n",
    "   - The metric ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured evaluation approach allows us to comprehensively assess our vacation destination agent's performance, both at the system level and the component level. By maintaining our focus on the singleton agent from Lab 3, we can clearly demonstrate these evaluation techniques without the added complexity of nested agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's proceed with implementing these evaluation methods to analyze our agent's effectiveness in handling vacation-related queries and tool interactions."

    "### Util functions part 2 - Message Format Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our singleton agent is built using the LangChain/LangGraph framework. LangChain defines several [message objects](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/chat/message_types/) to handle different types of communication within an agentic system. According to the LangChain documentation, these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HumanMessage: This represents a message from the user. Generally consists only of content.\n",
    "- AIMessage: This represents a message from the model. This may have additional_kwargs in it - for example tool_calls if using Amazon Bedrock tool calling.\n",
    "- ToolMessage: This represents the result of a tool call. In addition to role and content, this message has a `tool_call_id` parameter which conveys the id of the call to the tool that was called to produce this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, our evaluation framework RAGAS implements its own message wrapper objects:\n",
    "\n",

       "  AIMessage(content=\"It sounds like you may have ordered or been served an India Pale Ale (IPA) style beer, which is known for having a noticeable bitterness from the hops used in brewing.\\n\\nIPAs originated in England in the 19th century when brewers started adding more hops as a preservative for beers being shipped to India. The extra hops provided bitterness to balance the maltiness.\\n\\nThese days, American craft brewers, especially those in New England like the ones in Newport, have embraced and even amplified the hoppy, bitter characteristics in their IPAs. Some key reasons your beer may taste bitter:\\n\\n- Hop Varieties - Certain hop varieties like Cascade, Centennial, Columbus impart more bitterness than others like Citra or Mosaic which give more tropical/citrus flavors.\\n\\n- Dry-Hopping - Many brewers now dry-hop their IPAs, adding extra hops late in the process to increase aroma and flavor bitterness.\\n\\n- High IBUs - India Pale Ales typically have higher IBU (International Bitterness Unit) measurements than other beer styles, often 60 IBUs or higher.\\n\\n- Double/Imperial IPAs - These stronger, higher alcohol IPAs use even more hops, resulting in intense bitterness.\\n\\nIf you prefer a less bitter beer, I'd recommend trying some of the other styles Newport breweries offer like:\\n\\n- Blonde ales or golden ales\\n- Brown ales or porters \\n- Wheat beers or hefeweizens\\n- Stouts or porters\\n\\nLet me know if you need any other recommendations for beers with less of a bitter hop profile!\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '1e3c67f6-fc09-489c-9248-166062072f68', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'date': 'Tue, 05 Nov 2024 23:31:15 GMT', 'content-type': 'application/json', 'content-length': '1680', 'connection': 'keep-alive', 'x-amzn-requestid': '1e3c67f6-fc09-489c-9248-166062072f68'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}, 'stopReason': 'end_turn', 'metrics': {'latencyMs': 13927}}, id='run-12c2d7b0-612e-4b5b-ad97-81db1e068347-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3537, 'output_tokens': 371, 'total_tokens': 3908})]}"

The extra hops provided bitterness to balance the maltiness.\\n\\nThese days, American craft brewers, especially those in New England like the ones in Newport, have embraced and even amplified the hoppy, bitter characteristics in their IPAs. Some key reasons your beer may taste bitter:\\n\\n- Hop Varieties - Certain hop varieties like Cascade, Centennial, Columbus impart more bitterness than others like Citra or Mosaic which give more tropical/citrus flavors.\\n\\n- Dry-Hopping - Many brewers now dry-hop their IPAs, adding extra hops late in the process to increase aroma and flavor bitterness.\\n\\n- High IBUs - India Pale Ales typically have higher IBU (International Bitterness Unit) measurements than other beer styles, often 60 IBUs or higher.\\n\\n- Double/Imperial IPAs - These stronger, higher alcohol IPAs use even more hops, resulting in intense bitterness.\\n\\nIf you prefer a less bitter beer, I'd recommend trying some of the other styles Newport breweries offer like:\\n\\n- Blonde ales or golden ales\\n- Brown ales or porters \\n- Wheat beers or hefeweizens\\n- Stouts or porters\\n\\nLet me know if you need any other recommendations for beers with less of a bitter hop profile!\", metadata={'input_tokens': 3537, 'output_tokens': 371, 'total_tokens': 3908}, type='ai', tool_calls=[])]"

While the default behavior compares tool names and arguments using exact string matching, this may not always be optimal, particularly when dealing with natural language arguments. Therefore, we set the `arg_comparison_metric` to `NonLLMStringSimilarity`, which employs a semantic distance metric to determine the relevance of retrieved contexts more effectively."

    "Let's analyze the results and their relationship to each persona's interaction patterns with the agent. We encourage you to discuss these findings with your workshop group to gain deeper insights. Keep in mind that agent conversations are dynamic and non-deterministic, meaning evaluation results may vary across different runs.\n",

    "However, certain patterns emerge:\n",
    "- Stephen's conversations typically achieve a very high rating due to his focused and goal-oriented approach and the fact that he can be found in the travel database - this helps matching all tool call arguments\n",
    "- Jane's conversations typically achieve a high but slightly lower rating. While her conversation is focused and goal-oriented, she is not in the travel database. This causes the first tool call suggestions to be less deterministic, reducing the likelihood of Florida-based recommendations\n",
    "- Homer's interactions achieve very low scores since they are characterized by chaotic and divergent patterns. This makes it highly unlikely to match the correct tool call sequence"
