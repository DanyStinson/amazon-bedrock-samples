There are two notebooks showing direct ingestion of documents using a custom datasource.  The first uses JIRA as a datasource and the second uses Google Drive.  Instructions and screenshots can be found here:

[Jira Instructions](./JIRA-API-Access.pdf)

[Google Drive Instructions](./Google-Drive-API-Access.pdf)

Note:  This example doesnâ€™t include ingestion management at scale (for example queuing and retry logic).
