# Getting Started with Bedrock

 With the Amazon Bedrock serverless experience, you can quickly get started, easily experiment with FMs, privately customize FMs with your own data, and seamlessly integrate and deploy them into your applications using AWS tools and capabilities. Agents for Amazon Bedrock are fully managed and make it easier for developers to create generative-AI applications that can deliver up-to-date answers based on proprietary knowledge sources and complete tasks for a wide range of use cases. 

This repository contains examples to get you started with the core Amazon Bedrock APIs for each of the foundational model providers.
